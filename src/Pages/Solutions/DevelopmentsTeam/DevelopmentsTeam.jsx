It is such a unique and reader-friendly site, resources available for learners on Educative is well organized and deep, it helps break down tricky programming concepts into simple chunks and exercises for practice to solidify the learning experience.",

        "I've tried probably 5-7 different sites and Educative is easily the best. It perfectly blends explanation with interactivity ... On other sites like Codecademy, I often feel like they're asking me to do such a specific task to build such a specific product that if I were to move on to building my own from scratch, I'd be lost. I don't feel like that at all with Educative. Bravo!‚Äù",
